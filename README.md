# BGP-Lab
In this project using GNS3 we make a configuration to connect two branches using BGP protocols and two different ISPs one of them is the backup for the another 
So if we have any problem in any of two ISPs , we still have the connection to branch 
primary connection takes path: 172.10.0.0
Backup ISP takes path : 10.1.0.0
